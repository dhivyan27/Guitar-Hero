**Guitar Hero-Style Game (Functional Reactive Programming)**  
A fully functional Guitar Hero-inspired game built using **functional reactive programming (FRP)** principles. Players hit falling notes in sync with music, using precise timing and strategy to maximize their score. The game features dynamic note generation, reactive state management, and a clean separation of logic and rendering, all powered by **TypeScript** and FRP techniques.


**How to Play**  
1. **Start the Game**: Click anywhere on the screen to begin.  
2. **Gameplay**: Notes fall from the top of the screen in four columns. Use the keys **H**, **J**, **K**, and **L** to hit the notes as they reach the bottom.  
3. **Scoring**:  
   - Accurately hit notes to increase your score.  
   - Hitting notes at the wrong time decreases your score.  
   - Each missed note is counted separately.  
4. **Multiplier**: Build a streak of consecutive hits to increase your score multiplier. For every 10 consecutive hits, your multiplier increases by **0.2**.
